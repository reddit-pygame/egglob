#Challenge

Create an app for honing your Boggle skills. There are two different approaches you could take: clicking on letter tiles with
 the mouse or typing in letters with the keyboard. The logic involved in clicking on tiles is much simpler than for keyboard input. 
 
Note that the letter Q is actually Qu and counts as two letters for scoring.
